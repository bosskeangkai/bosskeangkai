## Hello everyone 
My name is Keangkai Ruangrongwat but you can call me Bos.
I am currently studying in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, KMUTT.

Apart from the field of engineering, business is what I am passionate about, such as SMEs and startups. Also I am studying and practicing about data analysis Not only I am familiar with basic data concepts in business but also excel, statistics, and programming language for data science and machine learning.

More specifically, I am very enthusiastic about business and how to bring the data concept to find out business insight, marketing segmentation, or what customers really want. Four of my best friends and I began our SME and startup projects together last year, in which I was the front-end to create a website and business strategy. We also got an opportunity to practice with our senior company, where they managed the security system. At that time, we worked on license plate real-time detection, and I was responsible for the front-end. After that, I had learned more data concepts, and that was the first time that I learned the word ‚Äúdata-driven decision‚Äù, which made me certain that what I've chosen is the right one.

I hope that you will know me better. 

Interests:
- SMEs and startups
- Data Analyst
- Business and Entrepreneur
- Digital Marketing
- Long-term-investing
- Reading book
- Traveling to anywhere without Thai people
